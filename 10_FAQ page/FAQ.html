                    JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive and dynamic features on websites. It runs in the user's browser, allowing for things like animations, form validation, and real-time updates without reloading the page. JavaScript is essential for making websites responsive and interactive.

                    HTML and CSS are partners that work together to create web pages.
                    and while they might be team mates, HTML and CSS visually look different, and they function differently too. So while you'll have
                    to learn both, it's easr to learn HTML and CSS together at the same
                    time. they aren't hard.
